Full Spectrum hemp oil is grown on a biodynamic farm in southern Oregon. This is because their extraction technique is kept at a very low pressure and temperature, which allows all the acidic components (CBDa, THCa) to remain. This is an almost entirely raw product, and as a result, this means all the acidic compounds are intact. #19 has a base of organic MCT coconut oil and hemp terpenes. Terpenes are added to the final product for flavor and effectiveness. CBDa and THCa have been considered useful in relieving inflammation and pain. #19 contains 4 mg total cannabinoids per drop.

The name Spagyric refers to the process of pulling apart and reassembling. For our Spagyric tincture, we extracted the oils and terpenes from the biomass through an alcohol extraction process.  We then burned the biomass at a high temperature.  We reintroduced the salts back into the tincture, let it sit several month and proceeded to do this a total of 3 times. This is an ancient process which reunites all the components (Body, Soul & Spirit or Salts Oils & Terpenes) of the plant to create a powerful tincture which may result in bioavailable minerals. Why is it an Alcohol Tincture? Extraction of the plant is done with organic grape alcohol for high potency tinctures. Alcohol is the only solvent that extracts the plants chemicals at the same ratio as the plant itself, also the alcohol is produced from the plants themselves! Therefore, the solvent for plants is made by plants! Please note, there is a very distinct taste of the alcoholic tincture in our Spagyric. Users note a very spicy, hot taste initially – but trust us it’s worth it. Close Reviews (0) Reviews There are no reviews yet.

How can real CBD oil help? At True Hemp Science, we harness the power of whole plant extracts to deliver a full-spectrum experience. Your body, mind, and spirit are inextricably linked, and quality, organic CBD products can help you find balance and focus on your personal health and wellness. With diverse backgrounds in farming, ranching, herbology, superfood production, and a wide range of diets, our team brings over two decades of experience in complementary fields together to create holistic hemp products that showcase our passion for health, nutrition, and spiritual well-being. The result is an appealing line of hemp CBD products that delivers the benefits you seek without unwanted side effects. Our Commitment to Quality, Organic CBD Oil What you put in and on your body is important, not only for general health and wellness but for your peace of mind. When you buy CBD oil, you want to know that it features quality ingredients, undergoes non-toxic processes, and delivers the full spectrum of chemical compounds found in the natural plant. The cannabis plant contains hundreds of chemical compounds. These include roughly a hundred cannabinoids that interact directly with receptors in the human endocannabinoid system, as well as terpenes, flavonoids, and other compounds responsible for the unique aromas, flavors, and other qualities of individual strains. Alone, these compounds have unique properties, although not all have been isolated and studied to determine their precise effects. Together, however, they produce an entourage effect, interacting to deliver even greater benefits. This is why the team at True Hemp Science strives to preserve all of the natural elements found in the whole plant throughout the extraction and production process. Our incredibly high standards for research, development, and manufacturing ensure the best outcomes when delivering premium hemp products. No matter your personal health and wellness goals, you’ll find that there’s something for everyone at True Hemp Science. Hemp CBD Sourced from Trusted Partners A chain is only as strong as its weakest link, which is why we go out of our way to ensure that every component of our operation, from beginning to end, meets our high standards for quality and purity. This starts with the source materials for our organic CBD oil. With over two decades of industry experience, we’ve developed relationships with reputable and reliable suppliers across the globe. Our partners range from domestic farms in Oregon, Colorado, and West Virginia, to international operations in the Netherlands and beyond. Our partners are chosen for their organic farming methods and their dedication to providing the highest quality hemp cannabis. With an eye toward safety, efficacy, and legality, we choose suppliers that deliver the finest products and strains, offering the flavors, aromas, and properties consumers demand. We always want you to feel confident that you’re getting outstanding products from start to finish, and our trusted partners are a big part of that equation. Our Advanced Processing Methods Sourcing whole plants from organic cultivators is a great place to start when it comes to developing safe, potent, real CBD oil. With that being said, plant materials still have to be processed, and some extraction methods are better than others. Preserving natural chemical compounds to create full-spectrum products is a top priority, but at True Hemp Science, we also want to avoid adding any harmful and unnecessary components to final products. This is why we use super/sub-critical CO2 or cryo-ethanol extraction methods. With these advanced techniques, we can extract not only concentrated cannabinoids but also the terpenes and other compounds that contribute to the entourage effect and deliver unique flavor profiles. We also vary the decarboxylation process to produce different effects. Natural hemp cannabis includes a variety of cannabinoids that can be altered during decarboxylation. For example, cannabidiolic acid (CBDA) is converted to CBD through the decarboxylation process, cannabigerolic acid (CBDG) becomes cannabigerol (CBG), and so on. By adjusting this process, we can produce a range of different cannabinoid blends and, by extension, different benefits and outcomes. At True Hemp Science, our methods are designed to produce clean, pure extracts, and we never use petrochemicals for processing. With a range of organic strains from farms across the globe and targeted processing techniques, you’ll enjoy a range of safe, effective products featuring only naturally-derived cannabinoids (never synthetic). Transparency Through Testing We understand that trust must be earned, and while we go out of our way to create the safe, potent products you expect and deserve, we also offer full transparency for your peace of mind. When you shop for CBD oil online, you want to know exactly what you’re getting. This is why we not only conduct in-house testing at multiple stages throughout the production process, but we submit to independent, third-party lab testing and post results online. We test for the presence and potency of primary cannabinoids, terpenes, heavy metals, pesticides, residual solvents, and microbes. You deserve safe and effective CBD oil free of harmful toxins, and you need to know that you’re getting what you pay for. With comprehensive, science-backed testing, you can feel confident that you’re making informed decisions about your wellness purchases. Real CBD Oil Solutions for Your Needs Consumers might buy CBD oil for many reasons, from seeking relief to improving focus to supporting a sense of calm and relaxation. Oils are an excellent medium to explore for a couple of reasons. First and foremost, oil products are compact and easy to store. Bottles can be discreetly locked away in a medicine cabinet or stored out of sight in a kitchen cabinet or drawer. In addition, it’s easy to start with a small dosage and scale up to achieve desired results. We always recommend letting the oil settle in your mouth for about 5mins after consumption to allow the terrines to work and absorb in the body. Terpenes provide a lot of health benefits and interact very similarly in the way cannabinoids do. Of course, you’ll first have to find the right products to best suit your needs and preferences. True Hemp Science is pleased to offer a range of appealing hemp CBD oil products to suit every customer. Full Spectrum CBDA Oil When life is coming at you like a freight train, you don’t have time to get derailed by stress or other distractions. You need to calmly process in order to remain organized and get everything done, but you don’t want to be so relaxed that you lose all motivation. Our full-spectrum CBD oil with CBDA offers a great-tasting and long-lasting solution for anyone seeking balance in everyday life. This product promotes relaxation but pairs it with invigorating effects that support focus and a positive attitude. This biodynamic, organic CBD product is made almost entirely raw, including acid compounds like CBDA found in the natural plant. An organic MCT coconut oil serves as the base for CBD extract, and terpenes have been added for outstanding flavor and efficacy. Full Spectrum CBG + CBDA + Terpenes Sometimes you want to fully relax, releasing all tension and letting go of your worries. Other times, you simply need to soothe your mental state without impairing cognitive function so that you can focus on the task at hand. In this case, an organic CBD oil designed for calming and positive mental support should suit your needs, and you’ll find it with our 4:1:1 ratio of CBG, CBDA, and CBD. While a small amount of stress can actually prove motivational, too much can leave you unable to concentrate and perform. This product is designed to uplift, energize, and support focus without the jitters or crash you’ll get with caffeine. Primary terpene beta-caryophyllene is known for its peppery flavor profile, and it contributes to calming sensations. Full-Spectrum Distillate CBD Oil A more traditional type of extraction, this product is no less a real CBD oil. It has simply undergone a distillation extraction that includes full decarboxylation. A very clean oil, our full-spectrum distillate is a great option for beginners, thanks to lower terpenes and a pleasant flavor that features hints of citrus. This product promotes gentle relaxation that’s perfect for winding down at the end of a long day, preparing for slumber, or chilling out on the weekends. While it doesn’t have a lot of extras found in some other products, you’re sure to find the lower price point appealing, especially if you’re seeking a mild, soothing experience. Whole Plant Full-Spectrum Extract — Super Terpenes The aromas and flavors of cannabis can be an acquired taste. If you’re a fan of the full range of terpenes, flavonoids, and other compounds that contribute to the unique bouquet of cannabis, you’re going to love our whole plant full-spectrum extract, in which terpenes feature prominently. Terpenes make up about 40% of the benefit by helping regulate hormones and lowering cortisol. This product contains some plant waxes and is a terpene-rich formulation, meaning you’ll enjoy strong natural flavors. We use a supercritical CO2 extraction method and 50/50 decarboxylation so that the final product includes both CBD and CBDA in a 1:1 ratio. Also present in a small amount is cannabichromene (CBC). The result is a product that enlivens the senses and promotes an uplifted mood while simultaneously promoting a sense of tranquility. If you’re looking for CBD oil online that offers a strong flavor profile with sensations of relief and relaxation, you’ll want to see what a whole plant extract can offer. Spagyric Alcohol Tincture When stress gets the best of you, it can leave you feeling distracted, unsettled, and out of your depth. It can impact your ability to focus and impair restful slumber as your mind tumbles through unwanted worries and thoughts. For our spagyric alcohol tincture, we used a time-tested process of alcohol extraction involving organic Cane alcohol to create a high-potency tincture. The process of extraction and heat takes three cycles and nine months to complete, but the end result is an extremely potent solution designed to promote deep relaxation. This product features an intense flavor. It is fully decarboxylated, with primary cannabinoids including a 9:1 ratio of CBD to CBG. Full-Spectrum CBD Oil — Raw This pure, organic CBD oil has a lot to offer, thanks to CO2 subcritical extraction and a terpene-rich formulation. A full-spectrum product, this oil features the full range of hemp cannabis compounds, with a 2:1 ratio of CBDA to CBD, as well as CBG. Terpene content is naturally high, but it has been boosted with distilled terpenes, particularly myrcene. The most abundant terpene found in cannabis, myrcene is known for earthy and sometimes fruity scents and flavors, and it contributes to a general sense of relaxation. Overall, this product pairs uplifting clarity with a deep sense of calm. Pet Soundz CBD MCT Oil While your pets are like members of the family, and you certainly want to do all you can to ensure their health and wellness, it’s not generally a good idea to give them products designed for human consumption. This is why True Hemp Science has developed a real CBD oil formulated specifically for pets weighing 0-20 pounds. This organic CBD coconut oil features only whole-plant supercritical CO2 hemp extract, rather than the typical isolate used in products for pets. This ensures that your fussy Fido or miserable Mr. Whiskers will enjoy the same range of natural chemical compounds that you get in your full-spectrum CBD products. Each drop contains 1mg of cannabidiol, so it’s easy to start small and work your way up to desired effects. A good rule of thumb is 1 drop for every 10lbs of your pet’s weight. Custom CBD Flights With so many appealing products to choose from, it can be difficult to select a single True Hemp Science product that meets all of your needs and preferences. The good news is you don’t have to pick just one. With our custom CBD flights, you can mix and match from our selection of CBD oil online to curate a collection that’s right for you. Choose from our collections of 2, 3, or 4 oils so you can sample new products or stock up on various favorites to suit different purposes. Education Through Consultation Your body is the vessel that takes you through life, and you want to treat it with respect and care, so you can enjoy peak performance and get where you want to go. The products you choose to put in and on your body need to meet your high standards for self-care and promote overall wellness and balance – body, mind, and spirit. At True Hemp Science, we believe health and wellness are treasures, and our products are designed to deliver the quality and efficacy you expect, without any harmful toxins, additives, or preservatives that could negatively impact your well-being. In order to ensure your ability to make informed decisions about your own wellness journey, we proudly offer consultation services.

The difficulty for many consumers is knowing which products offer the safety, potency, and consistency they prefer. At True Hemp Science, we aim to deliver the highest quality products at competitive prices and with full transparency, so you can trust that you’re getting the best products for your needs when purchasing CBD oil online. When we launched in 2015, we brought decades of industry knowledge and experience to our operation, along with a passion for creating premium, organic wellness products. With a global network of organic farming partners, a drive to innovate, and a commitment to upholding high standards and submitting to third-party testing, we always deliver safe and effective CBD products that fit your budget and provide peace of mind. We stand behind our products by offering a 30-day money-back guarantee. Products Driven by a Passion for Self-Care The busy, modern lifestyle doesn’t leave much time to focus on yourself. Between long work hours, a daily commute, and the demands of running a household, raising a family, and fulfilling other obligations, you barely have time to sleep – and when you do, your mind is a whirlwind of worries, what-ifs, and to-dos. True Hemp Science believes everyone deserves the opportunity to pursue greater personal awareness, improve their self-care routine, restore balance, and enjoy increased well-being. How can real CBD oil help? At True Hemp Science, we harness the power of whole plant extracts to deliver a full-spectrum experience. Your body, mind, and spirit are inextricably linked, and quality, organic CBD products can help you find balance and focus on your personal health and wellness. With diverse backgrounds in farming, ranching, herbology, superfood production, and a wide range of diets, our team brings over two decades of experience in complementary fields together to create holistic hemp products that showcase our passion for health, nutrition, and spiritual well-being. The result is an appealing line of hemp CBD products that delivers the benefits you seek without unwanted side effects. Our Commitment to Quality, Organic CBD Oil What you put in and on your body is important, not only for general health and wellness but for your peace of mind. When you buy CBD oil, you want to know that it features quality ingredients, undergoes non-toxic processes, and delivers the full spectrum of chemical compounds found in the natural plant. The cannabis plant contains hundreds of chemical compounds. These include roughly a hundred cannabinoids that interact directly with receptors in the human endocannabinoid system, as well as terpenes, flavonoids, and other compounds responsible for the unique aromas, flavors, and other qualities of individual strains. Alone, these compounds have unique properties, although not all have been isolated and studied to determine their precise effects. Together, however, they produce an entourage effect, interacting to deliver even greater benefits. This is why the team at True Hemp Science strives to preserve all of the natural elements found in the whole plant throughout the extraction and production process. Our incredibly high standards for research, development, and manufacturing ensure the best outcomes when delivering premium hemp products. No matter your personal health and wellness goals, you’ll find that there’s something for everyone at True Hemp Science. Hemp CBD Sourced from Trusted Partners A chain is only as strong as its weakest link, which is why we go out of our way to ensure that every component of our operation, from beginning to end, meets our high standards for quality and purity. This starts with the source materials for our organic CBD oil. With over two decades of industry experience, we’ve developed relationships with reputable and reliable suppliers across the globe. Our partners range from domestic farms in Oregon, Colorado, and West Virginia, to international operations in the Netherlands and beyond. Our partners are chosen for their organic farming methods and their dedication to providing the highest quality hemp cannabis. With an eye toward safety, efficacy, and legality, we choose suppliers that deliver the finest products and strains, offering the flavors, aromas, and properties consumers demand. We always want you to feel confident that you’re getting outstanding products from start to finish, and our trusted partners are a big part of that equation. Our Advanced Processing Methods Sourcing whole plants from organic cultivators is a great place to start when it comes to developing safe, potent, real CBD oil. With that being said, plant materials still have to be processed, and some extraction methods are better than others. Preserving natural chemical compounds to create full-spectrum products is a top priority, but at True Hemp Science, we also want to avoid adding any harmful and unnecessary components to final products. This is why we use super/sub-critical CO2 or cryo-ethanol extraction methods. With these advanced techniques, we can extract not only concentrated cannabinoids but also the terpenes and other compounds that contribute to the entourage effect and deliver unique flavor profiles. We also vary the decarboxylation process to produce different effects. Natural hemp cannabis includes a variety of cannabinoids that can be altered during decarboxylation. For example, cannabidiolic acid (CBDA) is converted to CBD through the decarboxylation process, cannabigerolic acid (CBDG) becomes cannabigerol (CBG), and so on. By adjusting this process, we can produce a range of different cannabinoid blends and, by extension, different benefits and outcomes. At True Hemp Science, our methods are designed to produce clean, pure extracts, and we never use petrochemicals for processing. With a range of organic strains from farms across the globe and targeted processing techniques, you’ll enjoy a range of safe, effective products featuring only naturally-derived cannabinoids (never synthetic). Transparency Through Testing We understand that trust must be earned, and while we go out of our way to create the safe, potent products you expect and deserve, we also offer full transparency for your peace of mind. When you shop for CBD oil online, you want to know exactly what you’re getting. This is why we not only conduct in-house testing at multiple stages throughout the production process, but we submit to independent, third-party lab testing and post results online. We test for the presence and potency of primary cannabinoids, terpenes, heavy metals, pesticides, residual solvents, and microbes. You deserve safe and effective CBD oil free of harmful toxins, and you need to know that you’re getting what you pay for. With comprehensive, science-backed testing, you can feel confident that you’re making informed decisions about your wellness purchases. Real CBD Oil Solutions for Your Needs Consumers might buy CBD oil for many reasons, from seeking relief to improving focus to supporting a sense of calm and relaxation. Oils are an excellent medium to explore for a couple of reasons. First and foremost, oil products are compact and easy to store. Bottles can be discreetly locked away in a medicine cabinet or stored out of sight in a kitchen cabinet or drawer. In addition, it’s easy to start with a small dosage and scale up to achieve desired results. We always recommend letting the oil settle in your mouth for about 5mins after consumption to allow the terrines to work and absorb in the body. Terpenes provide a lot of health benefits and interact very similarly in the way cannabinoids do. Of course, you’ll first have to find the right products to best suit your needs and preferences. True Hemp Science is pleased to offer a range of appealing hemp CBD oil products to suit every customer. Full Spectrum CBDA Oil When life is coming at you like a freight train, you don’t have time to get derailed by stress or other distractions. You need to calmly process in order to remain organized and get everything done, but you don’t want to be so relaxed that you lose all motivation. Our full-spectrum CBD oil with CBDA offers a great-tasting and long-lasting solution for anyone seeking balance in everyday life. This product promotes relaxation but pairs it with invigorating effects that support focus and a positive attitude. This biodynamic, organic CBD product is made almost entirely raw, including acid compounds like CBDA found in the natural plant. An organic MCT coconut oil serves as the base for CBD extract, and terpenes have been added for outstanding flavor and efficacy. Full Spectrum CBG + CBDA + Terpenes Sometimes you want to fully relax, releasing all tension and letting go of your worries. Other times, you simply need to soothe your mental state without impairing cognitive function so that you can focus on the task at hand. In this case, an organic CBD oil designed for calming and positive mental support should suit your needs, and you’ll find it with our 4:1:1 ratio of CBG, CBDA, and CBD. While a small amount of stress can actually prove motivational, too much can leave you unable to concentrate and perform. This product is designed to uplift, energize, and support focus without the jitters or crash you’ll get with caffeine. Primary terpene beta-caryophyllene is known for its peppery flavor profile, and it contributes to calming sensations. Full-Spectrum Distillate CBD Oil A more traditional type of extraction, this product is no less a real CBD oil. It has simply undergone a distillation extraction that includes full decarboxylation. A very clean oil, our full-spectrum distillate is a great option for beginners, thanks to lower terpenes and a pleasant flavor that features hints of citrus. This product promotes gentle relaxation that’s perfect for winding down at the end of a long day, preparing for slumber, or chilling out on the weekends. While it doesn’t have a lot of extras found in some other products, you’re sure to find the lower price point appealing, especially if you’re seeking a mild, soothing experience. Whole Plant Full-Spectrum Extract — Super Terpenes The aromas and flavors of cannabis can be an acquired taste. If you’re a fan of the full range of terpenes, flavonoids, and other compounds that contribute to the unique bouquet of cannabis, you’re going to love our whole plant full-spectrum extract, in which terpenes feature prominently. Terpenes make up about 40% of the benefit by helping regulate hormones and lowering cortisol. This product contains some plant waxes and is a terpene-rich formulation, meaning you’ll enjoy strong natural flavors. We use a supercritical CO2 extraction method and 50/50 decarboxylation so that the final product includes both CBD and CBDA in a 1:1 ratio. Also present in a small amount is cannabichromene (CBC). The result is a product that enlivens the senses and promotes an uplifted mood while simultaneously promoting a sense of tranquility. If you’re looking for CBD oil online that offers a strong flavor profile with sensations of relief and relaxation, you’ll want to see what a whole plant extract can offer. Spagyric Alcohol Tincture When stress gets the best of you, it can leave you feeling distracted, unsettled, and out of your depth. It can impact your ability to focus and impair restful slumber as your mind tumbles through unwanted worries and thoughts. For our spagyric alcohol tincture, we used a time-tested process of alcohol extraction involving organic Cane alcohol to create a high-potency tincture. The process of extraction and heat takes three cycles and nine months to complete, but the end result is an extremely potent solution designed to promote deep relaxation. This product features an intense flavor. It is fully decarboxylated, with primary cannabinoids including a 9:1 ratio of CBD to CBG. Full-Spectrum CBD Oil — Raw This pure, organic CBD oil has a lot to offer, thanks to CO2 subcritical extraction and a terpene-rich formulation. A full-spectrum product, this oil features the full range of hemp cannabis compounds, with a 2:1 ratio of CBDA to CBD, as well as CBG. Terpene content is naturally high, but it has been boosted with distilled terpenes, particularly myrcene. The most abundant terpene found in cannabis, myrcene is known for earthy and sometimes fruity scents and flavors, and it contributes to a general sense of relaxation. Overall, this product pairs uplifting clarity with a deep sense of calm. Pet Soundz CBD MCT Oil While your pets are like members of the family, and you certainly want to do all you can to ensure their health and wellness, it’s not generally a good idea to give them products designed for human consumption. This is why True Hemp Science has developed a real CBD oil formulated specifically for pets weighing 0-20 pounds. This organic CBD coconut oil features only whole-plant supercritical CO2 hemp extract, rather than the typical isolate used in products for pets. This ensures that your fussy Fido or miserable Mr. Whiskers will enjoy the same range of natural chemical compounds that you get in your full-spectrum CBD products. Each drop contains 1mg of cannabidiol, so it’s easy to start small and work your way up to desired effects. A good rule of thumb is 1 drop for every 10lbs of your pet’s weight. Custom CBD Flights With so many appealing products to choose from, it can be difficult to select a single True Hemp Science product that meets all of your needs and preferences. The good news is you don’t have to pick just one. With our custom CBD flights, you can mix and match from our selection of CBD oil online to curate a collection that’s right for you. Choose from our collections of 2, 3, or 4 oils so you can sample new products or stock up on various favorites to suit different purposes. Education Through Consultation Your body is the vessel that takes you through life, and you want to treat it with respect and care, so you can enjoy peak performance and get where you want to go. The products you choose to put in and on your body need to meet your high standards for self-care and promote overall wellness and balance – body, mind, and spirit. At True Hemp Science, we believe health and wellness are treasures, and our products are designed to deliver the quality and efficacy you expect, without any harmful toxins, additives, or preservatives that could negatively impact your well-being.

Buy Organic CBD Oil Online It isn’t hard to find hemp CBD products since the 2018 Farm Bill legalized industrial hemp. The difficulty for many consumers is knowing which products offer the safety, potency, and consistency they prefer. At True Hemp Science, we aim to deliver the highest quality products at competitive prices and with full transparency, so you can trust that you’re getting the best products for your needs when purchasing CBD oil online. When we launched in 2015, we brought decades of industry knowledge and experience to our operation, along with a passion for creating premium, organic wellness products. With a global network of organic farming partners, a drive to innovate, and a commitment to upholding high standards and submitting to third-party testing, we always deliver safe and effective CBD products that fit your budget and provide peace of mind. We stand behind our products by offering a 30-day money-back guarantee. Products Driven by a Passion for Self-Care The busy, modern lifestyle doesn’t leave much time to focus on yourself. Between long work hours, a daily commute, and the demands of running a household, raising a family, and fulfilling other obligations, you barely have time to sleep – and when you do, your mind is a whirlwind of worries, what-ifs, and to-dos. True Hemp Science believes everyone deserves the opportunity to pursue greater personal awareness, improve their self-care routine, restore balance, and enjoy increased well-being. How can real CBD oil help? At True Hemp Science, we harness the power of whole plant extracts to deliver a full-spectrum experience. Your body, mind, and spirit are inextricably linked, and quality, organic CBD products can help you find balance and focus on your personal health and wellness. With diverse backgrounds in farming, ranching, herbology, superfood production, and a wide range of diets, our team brings over two decades of experience in complementary fields together to create holistic hemp products that showcase our passion for health, nutrition, and spiritual well-being. The result is an appealing line of hemp CBD products that delivers the benefits you seek without unwanted side effects. Our Commitment to Quality, Organic CBD Oil What you put in and on your body is important, not only for general health and wellness but for your peace of mind. When you buy CBD oil, you want to know that it features quality ingredients, undergoes non-toxic processes, and delivers the full spectrum of chemical compounds found in the natural plant. The cannabis plant contains hundreds of chemical compounds. These include roughly a hundred cannabinoids that interact directly with receptors in the human endocannabinoid system, as well as terpenes, flavonoids, and other compounds responsible for the unique aromas, flavors, and other qualities of individual strains. Alone, these compounds have unique properties, although not all have been isolated and studied to determine their precise effects. Together, however, they produce an entourage effect, interacting to deliver even greater benefits. This is why the team at True Hemp Science strives to preserve all of the natural elements found in the whole plant throughout the extraction and production process. Our incredibly high standards for research, development, and manufacturing ensure the best outcomes when delivering premium hemp products. No matter your personal health and wellness goals, you’ll find that there’s something for everyone at True Hemp Science. Hemp CBD Sourced from Trusted Partners A chain is only as strong as its weakest link, which is why we go out of our way to ensure that every component of our operation, from beginning to end, meets our high standards for quality and purity. This starts with the source materials for our organic CBD oil. With over two decades of industry experience, we’ve developed relationships with reputable and reliable suppliers across the globe. Our partners range from domestic farms in Oregon, Colorado, and West Virginia, to international operations in the Netherlands and beyond. Our partners are chosen for their organic farming methods and their dedication to providing the highest quality hemp cannabis. With an eye toward safety, efficacy, and legality, we choose suppliers that deliver the finest products and strains, offering the flavors, aromas, and properties consumers demand. We always want you to feel confident that you’re getting outstanding products from start to finish, and our trusted partners are a big part of that equation. Our Advanced Processing Methods Sourcing whole plants from organic cultivators is a great place to start when it comes to developing safe, potent, real CBD oil. With that being said, plant materials still have to be processed, and some extraction methods are better than others. Preserving natural chemical compounds to create full-spectrum products is a top priority, but at True Hemp Science, we also want to avoid adding any harmful and unnecessary components to final products. This is why we use super/sub-critical CO2 or cryo-ethanol extraction methods. With these advanced techniques, we can extract not only concentrated cannabinoids but also the terpenes and other compounds that contribute to the entourage effect and deliver unique flavor profiles. We also vary the decarboxylation process to produce different effects. Natural hemp cannabis includes a variety of cannabinoids that can be altered during decarboxylation. For example, cannabidiolic acid (CBDA) is converted to CBD through the decarboxylation process, cannabigerolic acid (CBDG) becomes cannabigerol (CBG), and so on. By adjusting this process, we can produce a range of different cannabinoid blends and, by extension, different benefits and outcomes. At True Hemp Science, our methods are designed to produce clean, pure extracts, and we never use petrochemicals for processing. With a range of organic strains from farms across the globe and targeted processing techniques, you’ll enjoy a range of safe, effective products featuring only naturally-derived cannabinoids (never synthetic). Transparency Through Testing We understand that trust must be earned, and while we go out of our way to create the safe, potent products you expect and deserve, we also offer full transparency for your peace of mind. When you shop for CBD oil online, you want to know exactly what you’re getting. This is why we not only conduct in-house testing at multiple stages throughout the production process, but we submit to independent, third-party lab testing and post results online. We test for the presence and potency of primary cannabinoids, terpenes, heavy metals, pesticides, residual solvents, and microbes. You deserve safe and effective CBD oil free of harmful toxins, and you need to know that you’re getting what you pay for. With comprehensive, science-backed testing, you can feel confident that you’re making informed decisions about your wellness purchases. Real CBD Oil Solutions for Your Needs Consumers might buy CBD oil for many reasons, from seeking relief to improving focus to supporting a sense of calm and relaxation. Oils are an excellent medium to explore for a couple of reasons. First and foremost, oil products are compact and easy to store. Bottles can be discreetly locked away in a medicine cabinet or stored out of sight in a kitchen cabinet or drawer. In addition, it’s easy to start with a small dosage and scale up to achieve desired results. We always recommend letting the oil settle in your mouth for about 5mins after consumption to allow the terrines to work and absorb in the body. Terpenes provide a lot of health benefits and interact very similarly in the way cannabinoids do. Of course, you’ll first have to find the right products to best suit your needs and preferences. True Hemp Science is pleased to offer a range of appealing hemp CBD oil products to suit every customer. Full Spectrum CBDA Oil When life is coming at you like a freight train, you don’t have time to get derailed by stress or other distractions. You need to calmly process in order to remain organized and get everything done, but you don’t want to be so relaxed that you lose all motivation. Our full-spectrum CBD oil with CBDA offers a great-tasting and long-lasting solution for anyone seeking balance in everyday life. This product promotes relaxation but pairs it with invigorating effects that support focus and a positive attitude. This biodynamic, organic CBD product is made almost entirely raw, including acid compounds like CBDA found in the natural plant. An organic MCT coconut oil serves as the base for CBD extract, and terpenes have been added for outstanding flavor and efficacy. Full Spectrum CBG + CBDA + Terpenes Sometimes you want to fully relax, releasing all tension and letting go of your worries. Other times, you simply need to soothe your mental state without impairing cognitive function so that you can focus on the task at hand. In this case, an organic CBD oil designed for calming and positive mental support should suit your needs, and you’ll find it with our 4:1:1 ratio of CBG, CBDA, and CBD. While a small amount of stress can actually prove motivational, too much can leave you unable to concentrate and perform. This product is designed to uplift, energize, and support focus without the jitters or crash you’ll get with caffeine. Primary terpene beta-caryophyllene is known for its peppery flavor profile, and it contributes to calming sensations. Full-Spectrum Distillate CBD Oil A more traditional type of extraction, this product is no less a real CBD oil. It has simply undergone a distillation extraction that includes full decarboxylation. A very clean oil, our full-spectrum distillate is a great option for beginners, thanks to lower terpenes and a pleasant flavor that features hints of citrus. This product promotes gentle relaxation that’s perfect for winding down at the end of a long day, preparing for slumber, or chilling out on the weekends. While it doesn’t have a lot of extras found in some other products, you’re sure to find the lower price point appealing, especially if you’re seeking a mild, soothing experience. Whole Plant Full-Spectrum Extract — Super Terpenes The aromas and flavors of cannabis can be an acquired taste. If you’re a fan of the full range of terpenes, flavonoids, and other compounds that contribute to the unique bouquet of cannabis, you’re going to love our whole plant full-spectrum extract, in which terpenes feature prominently. Terpenes make up about 40% of the benefit by helping regulate hormones and lowering cortisol. This product contains some plant waxes and is a terpene-rich formulation, meaning you’ll enjoy strong natural flavors. We use a supercritical CO2 extraction method and 50/50 decarboxylation so that the final product includes both CBD and CBDA in a 1:1 ratio. Also present in a small amount is cannabichromene (CBC). The result is a product that enlivens the senses and promotes an uplifted mood while simultaneously promoting a sense of tranquility. If you’re looking for CBD oil online that offers a strong flavor profile with sensations of relief and relaxation, you’ll want to see what a whole plant extract can offer. Spagyric Alcohol Tincture When stress gets the best of you, it can leave you feeling distracted, unsettled, and out of your depth. It can impact your ability to focus and impair restful slumber as your mind tumbles through unwanted worries and thoughts. For our spagyric alcohol tincture, we used a time-tested process of alcohol extraction involving organic Cane alcohol to create a high-potency tincture. The process of extraction and heat takes three cycles and nine months to complete, but the end result is an extremely potent solution designed to promote deep relaxation. This product features an intense flavor. It is fully decarboxylated, with primary cannabinoids including a 9:1 ratio of CBD to CBG. Full-Spectrum CBD Oil — Raw This pure, organic CBD oil has a lot to offer, thanks to CO2 subcritical extraction and a terpene-rich formulation. A full-spectrum product, this oil features the full range of hemp cannabis compounds, with a 2:1 ratio of CBDA to CBD, as well as CBG. Terpene content is naturally high, but it has been boosted with distilled terpenes, particularly myrcene. The most abundant terpene found in cannabis, myrcene is known for earthy and sometimes fruity scents and flavors, and it contributes to a general sense of relaxation. Overall, this product pairs uplifting clarity with a deep sense of calm. Pet Soundz CBD MCT Oil While your pets are like members of the family, and you certainly want to do all you can to ensure their health and wellness, it’s not generally a good idea to give them products designed for human consumption. This is why True Hemp Science has developed a real CBD oil formulated specifically for pets weighing 0-20 pounds. This organic CBD coconut oil features only whole-plant supercritical CO2 hemp extract, rather than the typical isolate used in products for pets. This ensures that your fussy Fido or miserable Mr. Whiskers will enjoy the same range of natural chemical compounds that you get in your full-spectrum CBD products. Each drop contains 1mg of cannabidiol, so it’s easy to start small and work your way up to desired effects. A good rule of thumb is 1 drop for every 10lbs of your pet’s weight. Custom CBD Flights With so many appealing products to choose from, it can be difficult to select a single True Hemp Science product that meets all of your needs and preferences. The good news is you don’t have to pick just one. With our custom CBD flights, you can mix and match from our selection of CBD oil online to curate a collection that’s right for you. Choose from our collections of 2, 3, or 4 oils so you can sample new products or stock up on various favorites to suit different purposes. Education Through Consultation Your body is the vessel that takes you through life, and you want to treat it with respect and care, so you can enjoy peak performance and get where you want to go. The products you choose to put in and on your body need to meet your high standards for self-care and promote overall wellness and balance – body, mind, and spirit. At True Hemp Science, we believe health and wellness are treasures, and our products are designed to deliver the quality and efficacy you expect, without any harmful toxins, additives, or preservatives that could negatively impact your well-being. In order to ensure your ability to make informed decisions about your own wellness journey, we proudly offer consultation services. We encourage customers to contact us with questions or concerns to better understand our products and processes.

The difficulty for many consumers is knowing which products offer the safety, potency, and consistency they prefer. At True Hemp Science, we aim to deliver the highest quality products at competitive prices and with full transparency, so you can trust that you’re getting the best products for your needs when purchasing CBD oil online. When we launched in 2015, we brought decades of industry knowledge and experience to our operation, along with a passion for creating premium, organic wellness products. With a global network of organic farming partners, a drive to innovate, and a commitment to upholding high standards and submitting to third-party testing, we always deliver safe and effective CBD products that fit your budget and provide peace of mind. We stand behind our products by offering a 30-day money-back guarantee. Products Driven by a Passion for Self-Care The busy, modern lifestyle doesn’t leave much time to focus on yourself. Between long work hours, a daily commute, and the demands of running a household, raising a family, and fulfilling other obligations, you barely have time to sleep – and when you do, your mind is a whirlwind of worries, what-ifs, and to-dos. True Hemp Science believes everyone deserves the opportunity to pursue greater personal awareness, improve their self-care routine, restore balance, and enjoy increased well-being. How can real CBD oil help? At True Hemp Science, we harness the power of whole plant extracts to deliver a full-spectrum experience. Your body, mind, and spirit are inextricably linked, and quality, organic CBD products can help you find balance and focus on your personal health and wellness. With diverse backgrounds in farming, ranching, herbology, superfood production, and a wide range of diets, our team brings over two decades of experience in complementary fields together to create holistic hemp products that showcase our passion for health, nutrition, and spiritual well-being. The result is an appealing line of hemp CBD products that delivers the benefits you seek without unwanted side effects. Our Commitment to Quality, Organic CBD Oil What you put in and on your body is important, not only for general health and wellness but for your peace of mind. When you buy CBD oil, you want to know that it features quality ingredients, undergoes non-toxic processes, and delivers the full spectrum of chemical compounds found in the natural plant. The cannabis plant contains hundreds of chemical compounds. These include roughly a hundred cannabinoids that interact directly with receptors in the human endocannabinoid system, as well as terpenes, flavonoids, and other compounds responsible for the unique aromas, flavors, and other qualities of individual strains. Alone, these compounds have unique properties, although not all have been isolated and studied to determine their precise effects. Together, however, they produce an entourage effect, interacting to deliver even greater benefits. This is why the team at True Hemp Science strives to preserve all of the natural elements found in the whole plant throughout the extraction and production process. Our incredibly high standards for research, development, and manufacturing ensure the best outcomes when delivering premium hemp products. No matter your personal health and wellness goals, you’ll find that there’s something for everyone at True Hemp Science. Hemp CBD Sourced from Trusted Partners A chain is only as strong as its weakest link, which is why we go out of our way to ensure that every component of our operation, from beginning to end, meets our high standards for quality and purity. This starts with the source materials for our organic CBD oil. With over two decades of industry experience, we’ve developed relationships with reputable and reliable suppliers across the globe. Our partners range from domestic farms in Oregon, Colorado, and West Virginia, to international operations in the Netherlands and beyond. Our partners are chosen for their organic farming methods and their dedication to providing the highest quality hemp cannabis. With an eye toward safety, efficacy, and legality, we choose suppliers that deliver the finest products and strains, offering the flavors, aromas, and properties consumers demand. We always want you to feel confident that you’re getting outstanding products from start to finish, and our trusted partners are a big part of that equation. Our Advanced Processing Methods Sourcing whole plants from organic cultivators is a great place to start when it comes to developing safe, potent, real CBD oil. With that being said, plant materials still have to be processed, and some extraction methods are better than others. Preserving natural chemical compounds to create full-spectrum products is a top priority, but at True Hemp Science, we also want to avoid adding any harmful and unnecessary components to final products. This is why we use super/sub-critical CO2 or cryo-ethanol extraction methods. With these advanced techniques, we can extract not only concentrated cannabinoids but also the terpenes and other compounds that contribute to the entourage effect and deliver unique flavor profiles. We also vary the decarboxylation process to produce different effects. Natural hemp cannabis includes a variety of cannabinoids that can be altered during decarboxylation. For example, cannabidiolic acid (CBDA) is converted to CBD through the decarboxylation process, cannabigerolic acid (CBDG) becomes cannabigerol (CBG), and so on. By adjusting this process, we can produce a range of different cannabinoid blends and, by extension, different benefits and outcomes. At True Hemp Science, our methods are designed to produce clean, pure extracts, and we never use petrochemicals for processing. With a range of organic strains from farms across the globe and targeted processing techniques, you’ll enjoy a range of safe, effective products featuring only naturally-derived cannabinoids (never synthetic). Transparency Through Testing We understand that trust must be earned, and while we go out of our way to create the safe, potent products you expect and deserve, we also offer full transparency for your peace of mind. When you shop for CBD oil online, you want to know exactly what you’re getting. This is why we not only conduct in-house testing at multiple stages throughout the production process, but we submit to independent, third-party lab testing and post results online. We test for the presence and potency of primary cannabinoids, terpenes, heavy metals, pesticides, residual solvents, and microbes. You deserve safe and effective CBD oil free of harmful toxins, and you need to know that you’re getting what you pay for. With comprehensive, science-backed testing, you can feel confident that you’re making informed decisions about your wellness purchases. Real CBD Oil Solutions for Your Needs Consumers might buy CBD oil for many reasons, from seeking relief to improving focus to supporting a sense of calm and relaxation. Oils are an excellent medium to explore for a couple of reasons. First and foremost, oil products are compact and easy to store. Bottles can be discreetly locked away in a medicine cabinet or stored out of sight in a kitchen cabinet or drawer. In addition, it’s easy to start with a small dosage and scale up to achieve desired results. We always recommend letting the oil settle in your mouth for about 5mins after consumption to allow the terrines to work and absorb in the body. Terpenes provide a lot of health benefits and interact very similarly in the way cannabinoids do. Of course, you’ll first have to find the right products to best suit your needs and preferences. True Hemp Science is pleased to offer a range of appealing hemp CBD oil products to suit every customer. Full Spectrum CBDA Oil When life is coming at you like a freight train, you don’t have time to get derailed by stress or other distractions. You need to calmly process in order to remain organized and get everything done, but you don’t want to be so relaxed that you lose all motivation. Our full-spectrum CBD oil with CBDA offers a great-tasting and long-lasting solution for anyone seeking balance in everyday life. This product promotes relaxation but pairs it with invigorating effects that support focus and a positive attitude. This biodynamic, organic CBD product is made almost entirely raw, including acid compounds like CBDA found in the natural plant. An organic MCT coconut oil serves as the base for CBD extract, and terpenes have been added for outstanding flavor and efficacy. Full Spectrum CBG + CBDA + Terpenes Sometimes you want to fully relax, releasing all tension and letting go of your worries. Other times, you simply need to soothe your mental state without impairing cognitive function so that you can focus on the task at hand. In this case, an organic CBD oil designed for calming and positive mental support should suit your needs, and you’ll find it with our 4:1:1 ratio of CBG, CBDA, and CBD. While a small amount of stress can actually prove motivational, too much can leave you unable to concentrate and perform. This product is designed to uplift, energize, and support focus without the jitters or crash you’ll get with caffeine. Primary terpene beta-caryophyllene is known for its peppery flavor profile, and it contributes to calming sensations. Full-Spectrum Distillate CBD Oil A more traditional type of extraction, this product is no less a real CBD oil. It has simply undergone a distillation extraction that includes full decarboxylation. A very clean oil, our full-spectrum distillate is a great option for beginners, thanks to lower terpenes and a pleasant flavor that features hints of citrus. This product promotes gentle relaxation that’s perfect for winding down at the end of a long day, preparing for slumber, or chilling out on the weekends. While it doesn’t have a lot of extras found in some other products, you’re sure to find the lower price point appealing, especially if you’re seeking a mild, soothing experience. Whole Plant Full-Spectrum Extract — Super Terpenes The aromas and flavors of cannabis can be an acquired taste. If you’re a fan of the full range of terpenes, flavonoids, and other compounds that contribute to the unique bouquet of cannabis, you’re going to love our whole plant full-spectrum extract, in which terpenes feature prominently. Terpenes make up about 40% of the benefit by helping regulate hormones and lowering cortisol. This product contains some plant waxes and is a terpene-rich formulation, meaning you’ll enjoy strong natural flavors. We use a supercritical CO2 extraction method and 50/50 decarboxylation so that the final product includes both CBD and CBDA in a 1:1 ratio. Also present in a small amount is cannabichromene (CBC). The result is a product that enlivens the senses and promotes an uplifted mood while simultaneously promoting a sense of tranquility. If you’re looking for CBD oil online that offers a strong flavor profile with sensations of relief and relaxation, you’ll want to see what a whole plant extract can offer. Spagyric Alcohol Tincture When stress gets the best of you, it can leave you feeling distracted, unsettled, and out of your depth. It can impact your ability to focus and impair restful slumber as your mind tumbles through unwanted worries and thoughts. For our spagyric alcohol tincture, we used a time-tested process of alcohol extraction involving organic Cane alcohol to create a high-potency tincture. The process of extraction and heat takes three cycles and nine months to complete, but the end result is an extremely potent solution designed to promote deep relaxation. This product features an intense flavor. It is fully decarboxylated, with primary cannabinoids including a 9:1 ratio of CBD to CBG. Full-Spectrum CBD Oil — Raw This pure, organic CBD oil has a lot to offer, thanks to CO2 subcritical extraction and a terpene-rich formulation. A full-spectrum product, this oil features the full range of hemp cannabis compounds, with a 2:1 ratio of CBDA to CBD, as well as CBG. Terpene content is naturally high, but it has been boosted with distilled terpenes, particularly myrcene. The most abundant terpene found in cannabis, myrcene is known for earthy and sometimes fruity scents and flavors, and it contributes to a general sense of relaxation. Overall, this product pairs uplifting clarity with a deep sense of calm. Pet Soundz CBD MCT Oil While your pets are like members of the family, and you certainly want to do all you can to ensure their health and wellness, it’s not generally a good idea to give them products designed for human consumption. This is why True Hemp Science has developed a real CBD oil formulated specifically for pets weighing 0-20 pounds. This organic CBD coconut oil features only whole-plant supercritical CO2 hemp extract, rather than the typical isolate used in products for pets. This ensures that your fussy Fido or miserable Mr. Whiskers will enjoy the same range of natural chemical compounds that you get in your full-spectrum CBD products. Each drop contains 1mg of cannabidiol, so it’s easy to start small and work your way up to desired effects. A good rule of thumb is 1 drop for every 10lbs of your pet’s weight. Custom CBD Flights With so many appealing products to choose from, it can be difficult to select a single True Hemp Science product that meets all of your needs and preferences. The good news is you don’t have to pick just one. With our custom CBD flights, you can mix and match from our selection of CBD oil online to curate a collection that’s right for you. Choose from our collections of 2, 3, or 4 oils so you can sample new products or stock up on various favorites to suit different purposes. Education Through Consultation Your body is the vessel that takes you through life, and you want to treat it with respect and care, so you can enjoy peak performance and get where you want to go. The products you choose to put in and on your body need to meet your high standards for self-care and promote overall wellness and balance – body, mind, and spirit. At True Hemp Science, we believe health and wellness are treasures, and our products are designed to deliver the quality and efficacy you expect, without any harmful toxins, additives, or preservatives that could negatively impact your well-being. In order to ensure your ability to make informed decisions about your own wellness journey, we proudly offer consultation services.

Buy Organic CBD Oil Online It isn’t hard to find hemp CBD products since the 2018 Farm Bill legalized industrial hemp. The difficulty for many consumers is knowing which products offer the safety, potency, and consistency they prefer. At True Hemp Science, we aim to deliver the highest quality products at competitive prices and with full transparency, so you can trust that you’re getting the best products for your needs when purchasing CBD oil online. When we launched in 2015, we brought decades of industry knowledge and experience to our operation, along with a passion for creating premium, organic wellness products. With a global network of organic farming partners, a drive to innovate, and a commitment to upholding high standards and submitting to third-party testing, we always deliver safe and effective CBD products that fit your budget and provide peace of mind. We stand behind our products by offering a 30-day money-back guarantee. Products Driven by a Passion for Self-Care The busy, modern lifestyle doesn’t leave much time to focus on yourself. Between long work hours, a daily commute, and the demands of running a household, raising a family, and fulfilling other obligations, you barely have time to sleep – and when you do, your mind is a whirlwind of worries, what-ifs, and to-dos. True Hemp Science believes everyone deserves the opportunity to pursue greater personal awareness, improve their self-care routine, restore balance, and enjoy increased well-being. How can real CBD oil help? At True Hemp Science, we harness the power of whole plant extracts to deliver a full-spectrum experience. Your body, mind, and spirit are inextricably linked, and quality, organic CBD products can help you find balance and focus on your personal health and wellness. With diverse backgrounds in farming, ranching, herbology, superfood production, and a wide range of diets, our team brings over two decades of experience in complementary fields together to create holistic hemp products that showcase our passion for health, nutrition, and spiritual well-being. The result is an appealing line of hemp CBD products that delivers the benefits you seek without unwanted side effects. Our Commitment to Quality, Organic CBD Oil What you put in and on your body is important, not only for general health and wellness but for your peace of mind. When you buy CBD oil, you want to know that it features quality ingredients, undergoes non-toxic processes, and delivers the full spectrum of chemical compounds found in the natural plant. The cannabis plant contains hundreds of chemical compounds. These include roughly a hundred cannabinoids that interact directly with receptors in the human endocannabinoid system, as well as terpenes, flavonoids, and other compounds responsible for the unique aromas, flavors, and other qualities of individual strains. Alone, these compounds have unique properties, although not all have been isolated and studied to determine their precise effects. Together, however, they produce an entourage effect, interacting to deliver even greater benefits. This is why the team at True Hemp Science strives to preserve all of the natural elements found in the whole plant throughout the extraction and production process. Our incredibly high standards for research, development, and manufacturing ensure the best outcomes when delivering premium hemp products. No matter your personal health and wellness goals, you’ll find that there’s something for everyone at True Hemp Science. Hemp CBD Sourced from Trusted Partners A chain is only as strong as its weakest link, which is why we go out of our way to ensure that every component of our operation, from beginning to end, meets our high standards for quality and purity. This starts with the source materials for our organic CBD oil. With over two decades of industry experience, we’ve developed relationships with reputable and reliable suppliers across the globe. Our partners range from domestic farms in Oregon, Colorado, and West Virginia, to international operations in the Netherlands and beyond. Our partners are chosen for their organic farming methods and their dedication to providing the highest quality hemp cannabis. With an eye toward safety, efficacy, and legality, we choose suppliers that deliver the finest products and strains, offering the flavors, aromas, and properties consumers demand. We always want you to feel confident that you’re getting outstanding products from start to finish, and our trusted partners are a big part of that equation. Our Advanced Processing Methods Sourcing whole plants from organic cultivators is a great place to start when it comes to developing safe, potent, real CBD oil. With that being said, plant materials still have to be processed, and some extraction methods are better than others. Preserving natural chemical compounds to create full-spectrum products is a top priority, but at True Hemp Science, we also want to avoid adding any harmful and unnecessary components to final products. This is why we use super/sub-critical CO2 or cryo-ethanol extraction methods. With these advanced techniques, we can extract not only concentrated cannabinoids but also the terpenes and other compounds that contribute to the entourage effect and deliver unique flavor profiles. We also vary the decarboxylation process to produce different effects. Natural hemp cannabis includes a variety of cannabinoids that can be altered during decarboxylation. For example, cannabidiolic acid (CBDA) is converted to CBD through the decarboxylation process, cannabigerolic acid (CBDG) becomes cannabigerol (CBG), and so on. By adjusting this process, we can produce a range of different cannabinoid blends and, by extension, different benefits and outcomes. At True Hemp Science, our methods are designed to produce clean, pure extracts, and we never use petrochemicals for processing. With a range of organic strains from farms across the globe and targeted processing techniques, you’ll enjoy a range of safe, effective products featuring only naturally-derived cannabinoids (never synthetic). Transparency Through Testing We understand that trust must be earned, and while we go out of our way to create the safe, potent products you expect and deserve, we also offer full transparency for your peace of mind. When you shop for CBD oil online, you want to know exactly what you’re getting. This is why we not only conduct in-house testing at multiple stages throughout the production process, but we submit to independent, third-party lab testing and post results online. We test for the presence and potency of primary cannabinoids, terpenes, heavy metals, pesticides, residual solvents, and microbes. You deserve safe and effective CBD oil free of harmful toxins, and you need to know that you’re getting what you pay for. With comprehensive, science-backed testing, you can feel confident that you’re making informed decisions about your wellness purchases. Real CBD Oil Solutions for Your Needs Consumers might buy CBD oil for many reasons, from seeking relief to improving focus to supporting a sense of calm and relaxation. Oils are an excellent medium to explore for a couple of reasons. First and foremost, oil products are compact and easy to store. Bottles can be discreetly locked away in a medicine cabinet or stored out of sight in a kitchen cabinet or drawer. In addition, it’s easy to start with a small dosage and scale up to achieve desired results. We always recommend letting the oil settle in your mouth for about 5mins after consumption to allow the terrines to work and absorb in the body. Terpenes provide a lot of health benefits and interact very similarly in the way cannabinoids do. Of course, you’ll first have to find the right products to best suit your needs and preferences. True Hemp Science is pleased to offer a range of appealing hemp CBD oil products to suit every customer. Full Spectrum CBDA Oil When life is coming at you like a freight train, you don’t have time to get derailed by stress or other distractions. You need to calmly process in order to remain organized and get everything done, but you don’t want to be so relaxed that you lose all motivation. Our full-spectrum CBD oil with CBDA offers a great-tasting and long-lasting solution for anyone seeking balance in everyday life. This product promotes relaxation but pairs it with invigorating effects that support focus and a positive attitude. This biodynamic, organic CBD product is made almost entirely raw, including acid compounds like CBDA found in the natural plant. An organic MCT coconut oil serves as the base for CBD extract, and terpenes have been added for outstanding flavor and efficacy. Full Spectrum CBG + CBDA + Terpenes Sometimes you want to fully relax, releasing all tension and letting go of your worries. Other times, you simply need to soothe your mental state without impairing cognitive function so that you can focus on the task at hand. In this case, an organic CBD oil designed for calming and positive mental support should suit your needs, and you’ll find it with our 4:1:1 ratio of CBG, CBDA, and CBD. While a small amount of stress can actually prove motivational, too much can leave you unable to concentrate and perform. This product is designed to uplift, energize, and support focus without the jitters or crash you’ll get with caffeine. Primary terpene beta-caryophyllene is known for its peppery flavor profile, and it contributes to calming sensations. Full-Spectrum Distillate CBD Oil A more traditional type of extraction, this product is no less a real CBD oil. It has simply undergone a distillation extraction that includes full decarboxylation. A very clean oil, our full-spectrum distillate is a great option for beginners, thanks to lower terpenes and a pleasant flavor that features hints of citrus. This product promotes gentle relaxation that’s perfect for winding down at the end of a long day, preparing for slumber, or chilling out on the weekends. While it doesn’t have a lot of extras found in some other products, you’re sure to find the lower price point appealing, especially if you’re seeking a mild, soothing experience. Whole Plant Full-Spectrum Extract — Super Terpenes The aromas and flavors of cannabis can be an acquired taste. If you’re a fan of the full range of terpenes, flavonoids, and other compounds that contribute to the unique bouquet of cannabis, you’re going to love our whole plant full-spectrum extract, in which terpenes feature prominently. Terpenes make up about 40% of the benefit by helping regulate hormones and lowering cortisol. This product contains some plant waxes and is a terpene-rich formulation, meaning you’ll enjoy strong natural flavors. We use a supercritical CO2 extraction method and 50/50 decarboxylation so that the final product includes both CBD and CBDA in a 1:1 ratio. Also present in a small amount is cannabichromene (CBC). The result is a product that enlivens the senses and promotes an uplifted mood while simultaneously promoting a sense of tranquility. If you’re looking for CBD oil online that offers a strong flavor profile with sensations of relief and relaxation, you’ll want to see what a whole plant extract can offer. Spagyric Alcohol Tincture When stress gets the best of you, it can leave you feeling distracted, unsettled, and out of your depth. It can impact your ability to focus and impair restful slumber as your mind tumbles through unwanted worries and thoughts. For our spagyric alcohol tincture, we used a time-tested process of alcohol extraction involving organic Cane alcohol to create a high-potency tincture. The process of extraction and heat takes three cycles and nine months to complete, but the end result is an extremely potent solution designed to promote deep relaxation. This product features an intense flavor. It is fully decarboxylated, with primary cannabinoids including a 9:1 ratio of CBD to CBG. Full-Spectrum CBD Oil — Raw This pure, organic CBD oil has a lot to offer, thanks to CO2 subcritical extraction and a terpene-rich formulation. A full-spectrum product, this oil features the full range of hemp cannabis compounds, with a 2:1 ratio of CBDA to CBD, as well as CBG. Terpene content is naturally high, but it has been boosted with distilled terpenes, particularly myrcene. The most abundant terpene found in cannabis, myrcene is known for earthy and sometimes fruity scents and flavors, and it contributes to a general sense of relaxation. Overall, this product pairs uplifting clarity with a deep sense of calm. Pet Soundz CBD MCT Oil While your pets are like members of the family, and you certainly want to do all you can to ensure their health and wellness, it’s not generally a good idea to give them products designed for human consumption. This is why True Hemp Science has developed a real CBD oil formulated specifically for pets weighing 0-20 pounds. This organic CBD coconut oil features only whole-plant supercritical CO2 hemp extract, rather than the typical isolate used in products for pets. This ensures that your fussy Fido or miserable Mr. Whiskers will enjoy the same range of natural chemical compounds that you get in your full-spectrum CBD products. Each drop contains 1mg of cannabidiol, so it’s easy to start small and work your way up to desired effects. A good rule of thumb is 1 drop for every 10lbs of your pet’s weight. Custom CBD Flights With so many appealing products to choose from, it can be difficult to select a single True Hemp Science product that meets all of your needs and preferences. The good news is you don’t have to pick just one. With our custom CBD flights, you can mix and match from our selection of CBD oil online to curate a collection that’s right for you. Choose from our collections of 2, 3, or 4 oils so you can sample new products or stock up on various favorites to suit different purposes. Education Through Consultation Your body is the vessel that takes you through life, and you want to treat it with respect and care, so you can enjoy peak performance and get where you want to go. The products you choose to put in and on your body need to meet your high standards for self-care and promote overall wellness and balance – body, mind, and spirit.

The difficulty for many consumers is knowing which products offer the safety, potency, and consistency they prefer. At True Hemp Science, we aim to deliver the highest quality products at competitive prices and with full transparency, so you can trust that you’re getting the best products for your needs when purchasing CBD oil online. When we launched in 2015, we brought decades of industry knowledge and experience to our operation, along with a passion for creating premium, organic wellness products. With a global network of organic farming partners, a drive to innovate, and a commitment to upholding high standards and submitting to third-party testing, we always deliver safe and effective CBD products that fit your budget and provide peace of mind. We stand behind our products by offering a 30-day money-back guarantee. Products Driven by a Passion for Self-Care The busy, modern lifestyle doesn’t leave much time to focus on yourself. Between long work hours, a daily commute, and the demands of running a household, raising a family, and fulfilling other obligations, you barely have time to sleep – and when you do, your mind is a whirlwind of worries, what-ifs, and to-dos. True Hemp Science believes everyone deserves the opportunity to pursue greater personal awareness, improve their self-care routine, restore balance, and enjoy increased well-being. How can real CBD oil help? At True Hemp Science, we harness the power of whole plant extracts to deliver a full-spectrum experience. Your body, mind, and spirit are inextricably linked, and quality, organic CBD products can help you find balance and focus on your personal health and wellness. With diverse backgrounds in farming, ranching, herbology, superfood production, and a wide range of diets, our team brings over two decades of experience in complementary fields together to create holistic hemp products that showcase our passion for health, nutrition, and spiritual well-being. The result is an appealing line of hemp CBD products that delivers the benefits you seek without unwanted side effects. Our Commitment to Quality, Organic CBD Oil What you put in and on your body is important, not only for general health and wellness but for your peace of mind. When you buy CBD oil, you want to know that it features quality ingredients, undergoes non-toxic processes, and delivers the full spectrum of chemical compounds found in the natural plant. The cannabis plant contains hundreds of chemical compounds. These include roughly a hundred cannabinoids that interact directly with receptors in the human endocannabinoid system, as well as terpenes, flavonoids, and other compounds responsible for the unique aromas, flavors, and other qualities of individual strains. Alone, these compounds have unique properties, although not all have been isolated and studied to determine their precise effects. Together, however, they produce an entourage effect, interacting to deliver even greater benefits. This is why the team at True Hemp Science strives to preserve all of the natural elements found in the whole plant throughout the extraction and production process. Our incredibly high standards for research, development, and manufacturing ensure the best outcomes when delivering premium hemp products. No matter your personal health and wellness goals, you’ll find that there’s something for everyone at True Hemp Science. Hemp CBD Sourced from Trusted Partners A chain is only as strong as its weakest link, which is why we go out of our way to ensure that every component of our operation, from beginning to end, meets our high standards for quality and purity. This starts with the source materials for our organic CBD oil. With over two decades of industry experience, we’ve developed relationships with reputable and reliable suppliers across the globe. Our partners range from domestic farms in Oregon, Colorado, and West Virginia, to international operations in the Netherlands and beyond. Our partners are chosen for their organic farming methods and their dedication to providing the highest quality hemp cannabis. With an eye toward safety, efficacy, and legality, we choose suppliers that deliver the finest products and strains, offering the flavors, aromas, and properties consumers demand. We always want you to feel confident that you’re getting outstanding products from start to finish, and our trusted partners are a big part of that equation. Our Advanced Processing Methods Sourcing whole plants from organic cultivators is a great place to start when it comes to developing safe, potent, real CBD oil. With that being said, plant materials still have to be processed, and some extraction methods are better than others. Preserving natural chemical compounds to create full-spectrum products is a top priority, but at True Hemp Science, we also want to avoid adding any harmful and unnecessary components to final products. This is why we use super/sub-critical CO2 or cryo-ethanol extraction methods. With these advanced techniques, we can extract not only concentrated cannabinoids but also the terpenes and other compounds that contribute to the entourage effect and deliver unique flavor profiles. We also vary the decarboxylation process to produce different effects. Natural hemp cannabis includes a variety of cannabinoids that can be altered during decarboxylation. For example, cannabidiolic acid (CBDA) is converted to CBD through the decarboxylation process, cannabigerolic acid (CBDG) becomes cannabigerol (CBG), and so on. By adjusting this process, we can produce a range of different cannabinoid blends and, by extension, different benefits and outcomes. At True Hemp Science, our methods are designed to produce clean, pure extracts, and we never use petrochemicals for processing. With a range of organic strains from farms across the globe and targeted processing techniques, you’ll enjoy a range of safe, effective products featuring only naturally-derived cannabinoids (never synthetic). Transparency Through Testing We understand that trust must be earned, and while we go out of our way to create the safe, potent products you expect and deserve, we also offer full transparency for your peace of mind. When you shop for CBD oil online, you want to know exactly what you’re getting. This is why we not only conduct in-house testing at multiple stages throughout the production process, but we submit to independent, third-party lab testing and post results online. We test for the presence and potency of primary cannabinoids, terpenes, heavy metals, pesticides, residual solvents, and microbes. You deserve safe and effective CBD oil free of harmful toxins, and you need to know that you’re getting what you pay for. With comprehensive, science-backed testing, you can feel confident that you’re making informed decisions about your wellness purchases. Real CBD Oil Solutions for Your Needs Consumers might buy CBD oil for many reasons, from seeking relief to improving focus to supporting a sense of calm and relaxation. Oils are an excellent medium to explore for a couple of reasons. First and foremost, oil products are compact and easy to store. Bottles can be discreetly locked away in a medicine cabinet or stored out of sight in a kitchen cabinet or drawer. In addition, it’s easy to start with a small dosage and scale up to achieve desired results. We always recommend letting the oil settle in your mouth for about 5mins after consumption to allow the terrines to work and absorb in the body. Terpenes provide a lot of health benefits and interact very similarly in the way cannabinoids do. Of course, you’ll first have to find the right products to best suit your needs and preferences. True Hemp Science is pleased to offer a range of appealing hemp CBD oil products to suit every customer. Full Spectrum CBDA Oil When life is coming at you like a freight train, you don’t have time to get derailed by stress or other distractions. You need to calmly process in order to remain organized and get everything done, but you don’t want to be so relaxed that you lose all motivation. Our full-spectrum CBD oil with CBDA offers a great-tasting and long-lasting solution for anyone seeking balance in everyday life. This product promotes relaxation but pairs it with invigorating effects that support focus and a positive attitude. This biodynamic, organic CBD product is made almost entirely raw, including acid compounds like CBDA found in the natural plant. An organic MCT coconut oil serves as the base for CBD extract, and terpenes have been added for outstanding flavor and efficacy. Full Spectrum CBG + CBDA + Terpenes Sometimes you want to fully relax, releasing all tension and letting go of your worries. Other times, you simply need to soothe your mental state without impairing cognitive function so that you can focus on the task at hand. In this case, an organic CBD oil designed for calming and positive mental support should suit your needs, and you’ll find it with our 4:1:1 ratio of CBG, CBDA, and CBD. While a small amount of stress can actually prove motivational, too much can leave you unable to concentrate and perform. This product is designed to uplift, energize, and support focus without the jitters or crash you’ll get with caffeine. Primary terpene beta-caryophyllene is known for its peppery flavor profile, and it contributes to calming sensations. Full-Spectrum Distillate CBD Oil A more traditional type of extraction, this product is no less a real CBD oil. It has simply undergone a distillation extraction that includes full decarboxylation. A very clean oil, our full-spectrum distillate is a great option for beginners, thanks to lower terpenes and a pleasant flavor that features hints of citrus. This product promotes gentle relaxation that’s perfect for winding down at the end of a long day, preparing for slumber, or chilling out on the weekends. While it doesn’t have a lot of extras found in some other products, you’re sure to find the lower price point appealing, especially if you’re seeking a mild, soothing experience. Whole Plant Full-Spectrum Extract — Super Terpenes The aromas and flavors of cannabis can be an acquired taste. If you’re a fan of the full range of terpenes, flavonoids, and other compounds that contribute to the unique bouquet of cannabis, you’re going to love our whole plant full-spectrum extract, in which terpenes feature prominently. Terpenes make up about 40% of the benefit by helping regulate hormones and lowering cortisol. This product contains some plant waxes and is a terpene-rich formulation, meaning you’ll enjoy strong natural flavors. We use a supercritical CO2 extraction method and 50/50 decarboxylation so that the final product includes both CBD and CBDA in a 1:1 ratio. Also present in a small amount is cannabichromene (CBC). The result is a product that enlivens the senses and promotes an uplifted mood while simultaneously promoting a sense of tranquility. If you’re looking for CBD oil online that offers a strong flavor profile with sensations of relief and relaxation, you’ll want to see what a whole plant extract can offer. Spagyric Alcohol Tincture When stress gets the best of you, it can leave you feeling distracted, unsettled, and out of your depth. It can impact your ability to focus and impair restful slumber as your mind tumbles through unwanted worries and thoughts. For our spagyric alcohol tincture, we used a time-tested process of alcohol extraction involving organic Cane alcohol to create a high-potency tincture. The process of extraction and heat takes three cycles and nine months to complete, but the end result is an extremely potent solution designed to promote deep relaxation. This product features an intense flavor. It is fully decarboxylated, with primary cannabinoids including a 9:1 ratio of CBD to CBG. Full-Spectrum CBD Oil — Raw This pure, organic CBD oil has a lot to offer, thanks to CO2 subcritical extraction and a terpene-rich formulation. A full-spectrum product, this oil features the full range of hemp cannabis compounds, with a 2:1 ratio of CBDA to CBD, as well as CBG. Terpene content is naturally high, but it has been boosted with distilled terpenes, particularly myrcene. The most abundant terpene found in cannabis, myrcene is known for earthy and sometimes fruity scents and flavors, and it contributes to a general sense of relaxation. Overall, this product pairs uplifting clarity with a deep sense of calm.

CBD Questions What is Hemp Oil? Hemp oil is the essential oil of the hemp plant, containing plant waxes, omega oils, terpenes and the ever important cannabidiols. There are various methods to extract the oil: mechanical or solvents. There are benefits and disadvantages to each process. Solvents can range from CO2, organic alcohol to harsh petro-chemicals and mechical methods use high pressure. We use either cryto-ethonal where we wash the plant in food grade alcohol, filter and distill it to a concentrate. We prefer a process called Super-critical CO2 Extraction, which uses extreme pressure and CO2 gases to dissolve the plant into the resulting product. What are CBD’s? CBD is one of many compounds, known as cannabinoids, in the cannabis plant. What are Cannabinoids? A cannabinoid is one of a class of diverse chemical compounds that acts on cannabinoid receptors in cells that alter neurotransmitter release in the brain. Ligands for these receptor proteins include the endocannabinoids (produced naturally in the body by animals),the phytocannabinoids (found in cannabisand some other plants), and synthetic cannabinoids (manufactured artificially). The most notable cannabinoid is the phytocannabinoid tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), the primary psychoactive compound in cannabis. Cannabidiol (CBD) is another major constituent of the plant. Source: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cannabinoid Are CBD’s Psychoactive? CBD is known to be non-psychoactive. In layman’s terms, it won’t get you high. Unlike THC (also a cannabinoid), which is known to produce euphoric effects. What is the Endocannabinoid System? A system of receptors which exist inside the human body (endo meaning within). Humans have the capacity to produce their own cannabinoids and the hemp plant is rich in cannabinoids that fit into the receptors in the body. Where can I find more information? There are lots of detailed information out there. Here are a couple of sites: ProjectCBD.org National Institutes of Health What are the potential benefits of CBD? CBD, which is short for cannabidiol, has many potential effects on the body and mind. Sourced from the hemp plant, CBD offers therapeutic properties without the psychoactive high of THC. Many people have turned to CBD as a natural alternative to pharmaceutical drugs. For example, some people who might use addictive opiods to treat pain could try CBD instead. The same goes for sleep disorders, where sleeping pills might be the norm. CBD lacks the major side effects of more serious drugs, so it could be a promising alternative. What is the difference between Full Spectrum & CBD isolate? CBD isolate is fine white powder in appearance, and it is the purest, most concentrated form. It is 99 percent pure CBD with only traces of other components.  When refining the CBD to an isolate everything including plant materials, such as terpenes, chlorophyll, oils, waxes and THC as well as other cannabinoids all are removed to extract pure CBD crystals. We believe full spectrum hemp oil is the most effective product for the human endocannabodid system, as corroborated by the“Entourage Effect Study”. We source the highest quality product available and refine in it ways to preserve the integrity and nutrients of the plant. We do not use isolates in our products. What is CBG? Cannabigerol (CBG) is a non-psychoactive cannabinoid that plays an important role in the biochemistry of the cannabis plant. CBG acts as a chemical precursor to other cannabinoids such as THC and CBD. This conversion typically takes place 6-8 weeks in the flowering cycle. CBG is present only in trace amounts in most cannabis strains, however some hemp strains are specifically cultivated to generate higher yields of this cannabinoid. CBG displays a multitude of potential health benefits including working as a neuroprotectant, having antioxidant properties, aiding with skin ailments as an antibacterial and antifungal agent, appetite stimulation, treatment of gastrointestinal disorders, inflammation reduction, shows promise in fighting cancer, and lowering intraocular pressure, which may benefit glaucoma patients. How does CBG work? CBG interacts with both the CB1 and CB2 receptors, acting as a possible inhibitor to the psychoactive effects of THC. CBG is also thought to boost anandamide, an endocannabinoid that naturally increases dopamine levels and responsible for regulating various health functions such as mood, sleep, and appetite. GABA uptake in the brain may be obstructed by CBG, making this cannabinoid a possible anti-anxiety agent and muscle relaxant. CBG may also block serotonin receptors, showing potential antidepressant traits. CBG holds promise to be a key constituent in the overall medicinal benefits cannabis may provide. As cannabis research continues to rapidly evolve, CBG may emerge as one of the most therapeutically applicable and diverse cannabinoids to offer a wide range of possible remedies. CBG research CBG was examined for lowering intraocular pressure in a 1990 study , making it a possible glaucoma treatment. In a 2008 study CBG was found to be possibly beneficial in the treatment of MRSA due to its antibacterial and antifungal properties. A December 2014 study explored CBG as a possible agent to combat colorectal cancer. The neuroprotective properties of CBG were the subject of a January 2015 study, suggesting therapeutic potential for Huntington’s disease. CBG showed to be a particularly effective cannabinoid in a June 2015 study that focused on bladder dysfunction treatment options. An October 2016 study showed CBG to be potentially effective for inducing appetite. Will I test positive on a drug test? It is possible. Our products contain THC, therefore is it possible to test positive depending on factors such as: metabolism, sensitivity of the test and quality consumed. All True Hemp Science products use full spectrum hemp extracts, which contain trace amounts of naturally occurring THC. We are below the Federal legal limit and all our product have less than 0.3% THC by dry weight.

Between long work hours, a daily commute, and the demands of running a household, raising a family, and fulfilling other obligations, you barely have time to sleep – and when you do, your mind is a whirlwind of worries, what-ifs, and to-dos. True Hemp Science believes everyone deserves the opportunity to pursue greater personal awareness, improve their self-care routine, restore balance, and enjoy increased well-being. How can real CBD oil help? At True Hemp Science, we harness the power of whole plant extracts to deliver a full-spectrum experience. Your body, mind, and spirit are inextricably linked, and quality, organic CBD products can help you find balance and focus on your personal health and wellness. With diverse backgrounds in farming, ranching, herbology, superfood production, and a wide range of diets, our team brings over two decades of experience in complementary fields together to create holistic hemp products that showcase our passion for health, nutrition, and spiritual well-being. The result is an appealing line of hemp CBD products that delivers the benefits you seek without unwanted side effects. Our Commitment to Quality, Organic CBD Oil What you put in and on your body is important, not only for general health and wellness but for your peace of mind. When you buy CBD oil, you want to know that it features quality ingredients, undergoes non-toxic processes, and delivers the full spectrum of chemical compounds found in the natural plant. The cannabis plant contains hundreds of chemical compounds. These include roughly a hundred cannabinoids that interact directly with receptors in the human endocannabinoid system, as well as terpenes, flavonoids, and other compounds responsible for the unique aromas, flavors, and other qualities of individual strains. Alone, these compounds have unique properties, although not all have been isolated and studied to determine their precise effects. Together, however, they produce an entourage effect, interacting to deliver even greater benefits. This is why the team at True Hemp Science strives to preserve all of the natural elements found in the whole plant throughout the extraction and production process. Our incredibly high standards for research, development, and manufacturing ensure the best outcomes when delivering premium hemp products. No matter your personal health and wellness goals, you’ll find that there’s something for everyone at True Hemp Science. Hemp CBD Sourced from Trusted Partners A chain is only as strong as its weakest link, which is why we go out of our way to ensure that every component of our operation, from beginning to end, meets our high standards for quality and purity. This starts with the source materials for our organic CBD oil. With over two decades of industry experience, we’ve developed relationships with reputable and reliable suppliers across the globe. Our partners range from domestic farms in Oregon, Colorado, and West Virginia, to international operations in the Netherlands and beyond. Our partners are chosen for their organic farming methods and their dedication to providing the highest quality hemp cannabis. With an eye toward safety, efficacy, and legality, we choose suppliers that deliver the finest products and strains, offering the flavors, aromas, and properties consumers demand. We always want you to feel confident that you’re getting outstanding products from start to finish, and our trusted partners are a big part of that equation. Our Advanced Processing Methods Sourcing whole plants from organic cultivators is a great place to start when it comes to developing safe, potent, real CBD oil. With that being said, plant materials still have to be processed, and some extraction methods are better than others. Preserving natural chemical compounds to create full-spectrum products is a top priority, but at True Hemp Science, we also want to avoid adding any harmful and unnecessary components to final products. This is why we use super/sub-critical CO2 or cryo-ethanol extraction methods. With these advanced techniques, we can extract not only concentrated cannabinoids but also the terpenes and other compounds that contribute to the entourage effect and deliver unique flavor profiles. We also vary the decarboxylation process to produce different effects. Natural hemp cannabis includes a variety of cannabinoids that can be altered during decarboxylation. For example, cannabidiolic acid (CBDA) is converted to CBD through the decarboxylation process, cannabigerolic acid (CBDG) becomes cannabigerol (CBG), and so on. By adjusting this process, we can produce a range of different cannabinoid blends and, by extension, different benefits and outcomes. At True Hemp Science, our methods are designed to produce clean, pure extracts, and we never use petrochemicals for processing. With a range of organic strains from farms across the globe and targeted processing techniques, you’ll enjoy a range of safe, effective products featuring only naturally-derived cannabinoids (never synthetic). Transparency Through Testing We understand that trust must be earned, and while we go out of our way to create the safe, potent products you expect and deserve, we also offer full transparency for your peace of mind. When you shop for CBD oil online, you want to know exactly what you’re getting. This is why we not only conduct in-house testing at multiple stages throughout the production process, but we submit to independent, third-party lab testing and post results online. We test for the presence and potency of primary cannabinoids, terpenes, heavy metals, pesticides, residual solvents, and microbes. You deserve safe and effective CBD oil free of harmful toxins, and you need to know that you’re getting what you pay for. With comprehensive, science-backed testing, you can feel confident that you’re making informed decisions about your wellness purchases. Real CBD Oil Solutions for Your Needs Consumers might buy CBD oil for many reasons, from seeking relief to improving focus to supporting a sense of calm and relaxation. Oils are an excellent medium to explore for a couple of reasons. First and foremost, oil products are compact and easy to store. Bottles can be discreetly locked away in a medicine cabinet or stored out of sight in a kitchen cabinet or drawer. In addition, it’s easy to start with a small dosage and scale up to achieve desired results. We always recommend letting the oil settle in your mouth for about 5mins after consumption to allow the terrines to work and absorb in the body. Terpenes provide a lot of health benefits and interact very similarly in the way cannabinoids do. Of course, you’ll first have to find the right products to best suit your needs and preferences. True Hemp Science is pleased to offer a range of appealing hemp CBD oil products to suit every customer. Full Spectrum CBDA Oil When life is coming at you like a freight train, you don’t have time to get derailed by stress or other distractions. You need to calmly process in order to remain organized and get everything done, but you don’t want to be so relaxed that you lose all motivation. Our full-spectrum CBD oil with CBDA offers a great-tasting and long-lasting solution for anyone seeking balance in everyday life. This product promotes relaxation but pairs it with invigorating effects that support focus and a positive attitude. This biodynamic, organic CBD product is made almost entirely raw, including acid compounds like CBDA found in the natural plant. An organic MCT coconut oil serves as the base for CBD extract, and terpenes have been added for outstanding flavor and efficacy. Full Spectrum CBG + CBDA + Terpenes Sometimes you want to fully relax, releasing all tension and letting go of your worries. Other times, you simply need to soothe your mental state without impairing cognitive function so that you can focus on the task at hand. In this case, an organic CBD oil designed for calming and positive mental support should suit your needs, and you’ll find it with our 4:1:1 ratio of CBG, CBDA, and CBD. While a small amount of stress can actually prove motivational, too much can leave you unable to concentrate and perform. This product is designed to uplift, energize, and support focus without the jitters or crash you’ll get with caffeine. Primary terpene beta-caryophyllene is known for its peppery flavor profile, and it contributes to calming sensations. Full-Spectrum Distillate CBD Oil A more traditional type of extraction, this product is no less a real CBD oil. It has simply undergone a distillation extraction that includes full decarboxylation. A very clean oil, our full-spectrum distillate is a great option for beginners, thanks to lower terpenes and a pleasant flavor that features hints of citrus. This product promotes gentle relaxation that’s perfect for winding down at the end of a long day, preparing for slumber, or chilling out on the weekends. While it doesn’t have a lot of extras found in some other products, you’re sure to find the lower price point appealing, especially if you’re seeking a mild, soothing experience. Whole Plant Full-Spectrum Extract — Super Terpenes The aromas and flavors of cannabis can be an acquired taste. If you’re a fan of the full range of terpenes, flavonoids, and other compounds that contribute to the unique bouquet of cannabis, you’re going to love our whole plant full-spectrum extract, in which terpenes feature prominently. Terpenes make up about 40% of the benefit by helping regulate hormones and lowering cortisol. This product contains some plant waxes and is a terpene-rich formulation, meaning you’ll enjoy strong natural flavors. We use a supercritical CO2 extraction method and 50/50 decarboxylation so that the final product includes both CBD and CBDA in a 1:1 ratio. Also present in a small amount is cannabichromene (CBC). The result is a product that enlivens the senses and promotes an uplifted mood while simultaneously promoting a sense of tranquility. If you’re looking for CBD oil online that offers a strong flavor profile with sensations of relief and relaxation, you’ll want to see what a whole plant extract can offer. Spagyric Alcohol Tincture When stress gets the best of you, it can leave you feeling distracted, unsettled, and out of your depth. It can impact your ability to focus and impair restful slumber as your mind tumbles through unwanted worries and thoughts. For our spagyric alcohol tincture, we used a time-tested process of alcohol extraction involving organic Cane alcohol to create a high-potency tincture. The process of extraction and heat takes three cycles and nine months to complete, but the end result is an extremely potent solution designed to promote deep relaxation. This product features an intense flavor. It is fully decarboxylated, with primary cannabinoids including a 9:1 ratio of CBD to CBG. Full-Spectrum CBD Oil — Raw This pure, organic CBD oil has a lot to offer, thanks to CO2 subcritical extraction and a terpene-rich formulation. A full-spectrum product, this oil features the full range of hemp cannabis compounds, with a 2:1 ratio of CBDA to CBD, as well as CBG. Terpene content is naturally high, but it has been boosted with distilled terpenes, particularly myrcene. The most abundant terpene found in cannabis, myrcene is known for earthy and sometimes fruity scents and flavors, and it contributes to a general sense of relaxation. Overall, this product pairs uplifting clarity with a deep sense of calm. Pet Soundz CBD MCT Oil While your pets are like members of the family, and you certainly want to do all you can to ensure their health and wellness, it’s not generally a good idea to give them products designed for human consumption. This is why True Hemp Science has developed a real CBD oil formulated specifically for pets weighing 0-20 pounds. This organic CBD coconut oil features only whole-plant supercritical CO2 hemp extract, rather than the typical isolate used in products for pets. This ensures that your fussy Fido or miserable Mr. Whiskers will enjoy the same range of natural chemical compounds that you get in your full-spectrum CBD products. Each drop contains 1mg of cannabidiol, so it’s easy to start small and work your way up to desired effects. A good rule of thumb is 1 drop for every 10lbs of your pet’s weight. Custom CBD Flights With so many appealing products to choose from, it can be difficult to select a single True Hemp Science product that meets all of your needs and preferences. The good news is you don’t have to pick just one. With our custom CBD flights, you can mix and match from our selection of CBD oil online to curate a collection that’s right for you. Choose from our collections of 2, 3, or 4 oils so you can sample new products or stock up on various favorites to suit different purposes. Education Through Consultation Your body is the vessel that takes you through life, and you want to treat it with respect and care, so you can enjoy peak performance and get where you want to go. The products you choose to put in and on your body need to meet your high standards for self-care and promote overall wellness and balance – body, mind, and spirit.

Nature is beyond. She’s a mammoth. She’s an orca. She’s a panda. A salmon navigating magnetic fields across thousands of miles. She’s a geyser, she’s lava burning on the ocean floor. She’s a rainforest teeming with untold billions of specimens. She’s veins of gold coursing through the bowels of the earth. She’s tectonic subcontinents pushing mountains up into space. She’s a master, the perfector of perfection. Effortless precision of the utmost complexity. She’s all that, and all that we haven’t seen or imagined yet. She’s 14 billion years old, and she’s probably just getting started. Her kind of science makes our finest minds look feeble. It’s transcendent and primordial. Inborn and present since ever. A harmonious, evolving symphony of infinite detail crafted over billions of years, from the molecular level to the galactic. Rather than observe, deconstruct, hypothesize, and analyze, The Science of N ature creates and sustains life , the way it was designed to be. Put simply, she knows more about living well than every doctor, scientist, specialist, expert in history and on the planet put together will ever know. So when it comes to living well, the first and only things we should know is this: We can’t out-know nature. Nature is the ultimate scientist. She knows us better than we know ourselves.
