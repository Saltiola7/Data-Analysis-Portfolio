# Data Analysis Portfolio

Welcome to my data analysis portfolio, which showcases my use of Python/Jupyter with numPy, matplotlib, pandas, seaborn, scipy and plotly as well as Tableau. Jupyter Notebooks analyze datasets for Airline, McDonalds, Cancer patients and Oura Smart Ring. Tableau projects include Wallmart Sales Analysis and Globally scientifically documented use cases for Cannabis. 

## In the Jupyter Notebooks you find
- Data cleaning & fixing structural errors
- Check for outliers
- Descriptive Statistic
- Correlations
- Normality tests

## I answer questions like
- Why does higher % of gender 1 have malignant tumours?
- What other features may be linked to malignant tumours?
- What is Wallmarts most sold product?
- What are the most documented use cases for cannabis, where?

Take a look at each below or by navigating through the repository or my Tableau Public profile. Many of them are still a work in process. (These notebooks are made with Python 3.9.13)
